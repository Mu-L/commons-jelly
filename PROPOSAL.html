<h1>Proposal for <em>Jelly</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p><em>Jelly</em> is an XML based scripting and processing engine. Jelly borrows many 
good ideas from both JSP custom tags, Velocity, Cocoon, XMLC and the 
scripting engine inside XDoclet. Jelly can be used from the command line, inside 
Ant or inside a Servlet. 
</p>

<p>
Jelly is completely extendable via custom tags in a similar way to JSP. 
Though Jelly is really simple and has no dependencies either Servlets or JSP.
</p>

<p>We hope Jelly can be both an XML processing and transformation engine, a HTTP 
/ JMS / SOAP scripting engine as well as an XML based unit testing framework for 
testing XML based applications and web services.</p>

<p>As an experiment some of the JSTL tags are implemented.</p>

<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>
<p>
   The package will create and maintain a number of classes for
   implementing a simple scripting engine and to be distributed under the ASF license.
</p>

<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p><em>Jelly</em> relies  on standard JDK 1.2 (or later) APIs for 
production deployment.

<p><i>Jelly</i> also currently uses the following packages from Jakarta 
Commons<ul>
  <li>Collections (1.1 or greater)</li>
  <li>Logging (1.0 or greater)</li>
  <li>BeanUtils (1.1 or greater)</li>
  <li>Jexl (1.0 or greater)</li>
  </ul>

<p><i>Jelly</i> also uses these other libraries</p>
<ul>
  <li>dom4j (1.3 or greater)</li>
  </ul>

<p><i>Jelly</i> utilizes the JUnit unit testing framework for developing and 
executing unit tests, but this is of interest only to developers of the 
component.

<p> No external configuration files are utilized. </p>

<h3>(2) Initial Source of the Package</h3>

<p>
   The code base is new and uses ideas from JSP taglibs, Velocity and XDoclet as 
   well as incorporating pipelining ideas from Cocoon and XML processing ideas 
   from XMLC.
</p>

<p>The proposed package name for the new component is
<code>org.apache.commons.jelly</code>.</p>


<h3>(3)  Required Jakarta-Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>CVS Repository - New directory <code>jelly</code> in the
    <code>jakarta-commons</code> CVS repository.  All initial committers
    are already committers on <code>jakarta-commons</code>, so no
    additional user setups are required.</li>
<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
    <em>jakarta-commons@jakarta.apache.org</em> mailing list.  To help
    list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
    the message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
    [Jelly].</li>
<li>Bugzilla - New component "Jelly" under the "Commons" product
    category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>
<li>Jyve FAQ - New category "commons-jelly" (when available).
</ul>
