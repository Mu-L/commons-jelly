<h1>Proposal for <em>Jelly</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>The <em>Jelly</em> package implements a simple XML tag based scripting 
engine. It borrows many ideas from both JSP custom tags, Velocity and the 
scripting engine inside XDoclet. Jelly can be used from the command line, inside 
Ant or inside a Servlet. It allows the engine to be extended using custom tags 
in a similar way to JSP. Though Jelly is really simple and has no dependencies 
on JSP.</p>

<p>As an experiment some of the JSTL tags are implemented.</p>

<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>
<p>
   The package will create and maintain a number of classes for
   implementing a simple scripting engine and to be distributed under the ASF license.
</p>

<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p><em>Jelly</em> relies only on standard JDK 1.2 (or later) APIs for 
production deployment.

<p><i>Jelly</i> also currently uses the following packages from Jakarta 
Commons<ul>
  <li>Collections (1.1 or greater)</li>
  <li>Logging (1.0 or greater)</li>
  <li>BeanUtils (1.1 or greater)</li>
  </ul>

<p>The XML tags uses</p>
<ul>
  <li>dom4j (1.1 or greater)</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Jelly</i> utilizes the JUnit unit testing framework for developing and 
executing unit tests, but this is of interest only to developers of the 
component.

<p> No external configuration files are utilized. </p>

<h3>(2) Initial Source of the Package</h3>

<p>
   The code base is new and uses ideas from JSP taglibs, Velocity and XDoclet.
</p>

<p>The proposed package name for the new component is
<code>org.apache.commons.jelly</code>.</p>


<h3>(3)  Required Jakarta-Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>CVS Repository - New directory <code>jelly</code> in the
    <code>jakarta-commons</code> CVS repository.  All initial committers
    are already committers on <code>jakarta-commons</code>, so no
    additional user setups are required.</li>
<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
    <em>jakarta-commons@jakarta.apache.org</em> mailing list.  To help
    list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
    the message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
    [Jelly].</li>
<li>Bugzilla - New component "Jelly" under the "Commons" product
    category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>
<li>Jyve FAQ - New category "commons-jelly" (when available).
</ul>
