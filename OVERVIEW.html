<h1>Jakarta Commons <i>Jelly</i> Overview</h1>

<p>Jelly is a simple yet powerful scripting engine. Jelly is totally extendable 
via custom tags (like JSP) as well as cleanly integrating with other scripting 
languages via BSF (Bean Scripting Framework).</p>

<h2>Comparisons</h2>

<p>To try give you a better feel for what Jelly is, we'll compare and contrast 
Jelly with other scripting engines and templating technologies.</p>

<h3>Jelly versus JSP</h3>

<p>Similarities</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jelly uses the concept of custom tag libraries from JSP and follows many 
  of the lessons learnt from the JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library). Indeed JSTL 
  could be implemented in Jelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Differences</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jelly has no dependency on Servlets or JSP so Jelly can be run from the 
  command line, inside Ant, inside an applet or anywhere that Java code can be 
  ran.</li>
  <li>Jelly tags are much simpler to write and use than JSP tags. Because JSP 
  must support scriptlets due to backwards compatibility issues, they are 
  implemented 'inside out' with 3 different interfaces (Tag, BodyTag, 
  IterationTag) to implement based on the kind of tag you are writing, together 
  with a fairly complex set of event-based methods that are called by the page 
  container. Jelly tags are very easy - just derive from TagSupport and 
  implement the run() method. Really simple!</li>
  <li>Jelly tags can parse and compile their bodies for more optimal performance 
  and easier validation. So a tag can ignore whitespace, iterate over its body, 
  transform its body etc. So a Jelly tag can be a simple macro, preprocessing 
  its body at compile time, such as to build smart HTML forms or to make SOAP 
  macros etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jelly versus Velocity</h3>

<p>Similarities</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jelly allows Java objects to be manipulated in a Java-like manner just 
  like Velocity.</li>
  <li>Jelly could have a <i>surface syntax</i> that looks similar to Velocity. 
  i.e. someone could make a parser of Jelly that had a look-and-feel of Velocity 
  for common directives and expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Differences</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jelly provides an extensible tag mechanism to provide more poweful 
  scripting such as by supporting JSTL, XML, XPath, XSLT, SQL or SOAP service 
  scripting.</li>
  <li>Jelly has integrated support for other scripting languages such as 
  JavaScript, NetRexx, Jython etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible uses for Jelly</h2>

<p>Jelly has various possible uses. Here's a few to think about</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alternative to Velocity &amp; JSP</li>
  <li>Page templating system</li>
  <li>Code generation system</li>
  <li>SOAP, HTTP and/or JMS based scripting framework</li>
  <li>Ant scripting</li>
  <li>Alternative implementation of JSTL</li>
  <li>Enhanced scripting engine for XDoclet</li>
</ul>
