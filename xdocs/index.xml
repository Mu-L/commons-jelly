<section name="Jelly : Java and XML based scripting engine">

<p>
  <b>Jelly</b> 
</p>

<p><em>Jelly</em> is an XML based scripting and processing engine. Jelly borrows many 
good ideas from both JSP custom tags, Velocity, Cocoon and the 
scripting engine inside XDoclet. Jelly can be used from the command line, inside 
Ant or inside a Servlet. 
</p>

<p>
Jelly is completely extendable via custom tags in a similar way to JSP. 
Though Jelly is really simple and has no dependencies either Servlets or JSP.
</p>

<p>
Jelly is based on an XML event pipeline architecture (SAX), like Cocoon, rather than being purely text
based like JSP and Velocity. This means that Jelly tags can consume XML events and emit them. Each
Jelly custom tag can then act as an XML source, result or transformation.
</p>

<p>We hope Jelly can be both an XML processing and transformation engine, 
a web and XML based scripting engine as well as a unit testing framework for 
testing web applications and web services.
In addition Jelly can act as a stand alone lightweight engine for running JSTL 
scripts which can be run from the command line, inside SOAP services or from Ant.
