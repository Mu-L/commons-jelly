<section name="Jelly : Java and XML based scripting engine">

<p>
  <b>Jelly</b> 
</p>

<p><em>Jelly</em> is an XML based scripting and processing engine. Jelly borrows many 
good ideas from both JSP custom tags, Velocity, Cocoon and the 
scripting engine inside XDoclet. Jelly can be used from the command line, inside 
Ant or inside a Servlet. 
</p>

<p>
Jelly is completely extendable via custom tags in a similar way to JSP. 
Though Jelly is really simple and has no dependencies either Servlets or JSP.
</p>

<p>We hope Jelly can be both an XML processing and transformation engine, a HTTP 
/ JMS / SOAP scripting engine as well as an XML based unit testing framework for 
testing XML based applications and web services.</p>
